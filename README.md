# 118-capstone

This project will demonstrate a tool that calculates measurement unit conversions under a few categories (weight, length, volume, temperature) for the user. Additionally this project will include a feature where it will show the history of conversions made by the user. 

Inside of the database, that the app uses, each query will be tied to the user who made the query.
